                  <p>It was in 1982 with a Commodore 64 (you remember that one?) when Frank discovered his passion for programming and computer technology (that time with Basic and machine language) at the age of 12.</p>
                  <p>From then on his journey and passion continued steadily. All along this path the excitement and comprehension for different programming languages and architectures grew - and together with that, the eagerness to find out how to solve specific problems with the appropriate tools for the problems (languages and architectural patterns).</p>
                  <p>At the age of 16 he sold his first application, after finishing school, began to study computer science at the University of Saarbr√ºcken (Germany) just to be overwhelmed by his passion again after 4 years, quit University and founded his own company (network technologies and application development).</p>
                  <p>Ten years later he joined Nero and worked there as software engineer, solution architect, team leader and finally as technical director just to join the then just founded startup Stashimi another ten years later where he now works as architect with a completely serverless based infrastructure.</p>
