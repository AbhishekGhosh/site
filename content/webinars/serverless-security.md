  Serverless architectures is the next wave of cloud computing. While everyone is excited about the potential of serverless computing, there are many considerations in developer tooling and evolving areas of security, observability, monitoring, debugging, logging and auditing. Especially in the area of security, there are a lot of loose ends that need to be addressed.

  <ul>
    <li>What are the security challenges that organizations are facing when migrating or adopting serverless?</li>
    <li>How is security stack different from the traditional architectures?</li>
    <li>How does security compliance factor in?</li>
    <li>What security measures need to enforced above and beyond the cloud provider?</li>
    <li>Does security impact performance?</li>
  </ul>
