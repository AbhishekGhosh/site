We are incredibly proud of the way the Serverless community steps up to the plate on a daily basis to contribute to the project and help guide newcomers.

To recognize our community superstars, we established the **Serverless Champions** program.

Our champions show serverless thought leadership. They contribute to serverless open source projects. They are all-around ambassadors in the community.
